================================== Ai Message ==================================

Yes, you are allowed to update your flight to an earlier time. Here are the key points to consider for changing your flight:

1. **Eligibility**: Your ticket must start with 724 (SWISS ticket number), and there must be an active flight booking associated with your ticket. It is not possible to rebook open tickets or tickets without corresponding flight segments online at the moment.

2. **Restrictions**: You cannot change the origin, destination, or passenger names online. Also, changes cannot be made to tickets that are part of a group booking or have special services like transportation of animals or medical equipment.

3. **Timing**: If you are departing from a Swiss airport, you can rebook online up to three hours before departure.

4. **Seat and Special Requests**: Your seat reservation and any special meal requests will be included in the rebooking.

5. **Travel Insurance**: If you have travel insurance obtained through SWISS, it will remain valid and be included in the new ticket.

Would you like me to search for available flights departing later today for you to consider changing to?

It seems there was an issue with updating your flight to the selected date of May 20, 2024, due to a policy restriction that requires changes to be made at least 3 hours before the flight's scheduled departure.

Let's try updating your flight to another available option. Here are a few upcoming flights:

2. **May 1, 2024** - Departure at 12:09 PM
3. **May 24, 2024** - Departure at 12:09 PM
